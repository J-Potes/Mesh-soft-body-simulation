# Mesh-soft-body-simulation

Hello everyone, this was an assigment for Simulation class. The objective was to create a simulation of a soft body mesh using the physics from springs. 
The yellow piece is pulled with a force to begin the movement. The red pieces are static.

It needs pygame and OpenGL.

In the current version, most of the code is written in Spanish.
